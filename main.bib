Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

To overcome the difficulty of evaluating the predictive likelihood, we introduce the concept of expected log-predictive likelihoods for Bayesian models, and propose an estimator of the expected log-predictive likelihood. The estimator is derived by correcting the asymptotic bias of the log-likelihood of the predictive distribution as an estimate of its expected value. We investigate the relationship between the proposed criterion and the traditional information criteria and show that the proposed criterion is a natural extension of the traditional ones. A new model selection criterion and a new model averaging method are then developed, with the weights for the individual models being dependent on their expected log-predictive likelihoods. We examine the performance of the proposed method using Monte Carlo experiments and a real example, which concerns the prediction of quarterly growth rates of real gross domestic product in the G7 countries. Out-of-sample forecasts show that the proposed methodology outperforms other methods available in the literature.},

But at the same time, they introduce the restriction that each equation features the same set of explanatory variables. This paper proposes a straightforward means of postprocessing posterior estimates of a conjugate Bayesian {VAR} to effectively perform equation-specific covariate selection. Compared with existing techniques using shrinkage alone, our approach combines shrinkage and sparsity in both the {VAR} coefficients and the error variance–covariance matrices, greatly reducing estimation uncertainty in large dimensions while maintaining computational tractability. We illustrate our approach by means of two applications. The first application uses synthetic data to investigate the properties of the model across different data-generating processes, and the second application analyzes the predictive gains from sparsification in a forecasting exercise for U.S. data.},

	abstract = {This paper applies neural network models to forecast inflation. The use of a particular recurrent neural network, the long-short term memory model, or {LSTM}, that summarizes macroeconomic information into common components is a major contribution of the paper. Results from an exercise with {US} data indicate that the estimated neural nets usually present better forecasting performance than standard benchmarks, especially at long horizons. The {LSTM} in particular is found to outperform the traditional feed-forward network at long horizons, suggesting an advantage of the recurrent model in capturing the long-term trend of inflation. This finding can be rationalized by the so called long memory of the {LSTM} that incorporates relatively old information in the forecast as long as accuracy is improved, while economizing in the number of estimated parameters. Interestingly, the neural nets containing macroeconomic information capture well the features of inflation during and after the Great Recession, possibly indicating a role for nonlinearities and macro information in this episode. The estimated common components used in the forecast seem able to capture the business cycle dynamics, as well as information on prices.},

	abstract = {{SUMMARY} This paper is motivated by the recent interest in the use of Bayesian {VARs} for forecasting, even in cases where the number of dependent variables is large. In such cases factor methods have been traditionally used, but recent work using a particular prior suggests that Bayesian {VAR} methods can forecast better. In this paper, we consider a range of alternative priors which have been used with small {VARs}, discuss the issues which arise when they are used with medium and large {VARs} and examine their forecast performance using a {US} macroeconomic dataset containing 168 variables. We find that Bayesian {VARs} do tend to forecast better than factor methods and provide an extensive comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches. Typically, we find that the simple Minnesota prior forecasts well in medium and large {VARs}, which makes this prior attractive relative to computationally more demanding alternatives. Our empirical results show the importance of using forecast metrics based on the entire predictive density, instead of relying solely on those based on point forecasts.

	title = {Signal Adaptive Variable Selector for the Horseshoe Prior},
	abstract = {In this article, we propose a simple method to perform variable selection as a post model-fitting exercise using continuous shrinkage priors such as the popular horseshoe prior. The proposed Signal Adaptive Variable Selector ({SAVS}) approach post-processes a point estimate such as the posterior mean to group the variables into signals and nulls. The approach is completely automated and does not require specification of any tuning parameters. We carried out a comprehensive simulation study to compare the performance of the proposed {SAVS} approach to frequentist penalization procedures and Bayesian model selection procedures. {SAVS} was found to be highly competitive across all the settings considered, and was particularly found to be robust to correlated designs. We also applied {SAVS} to a genomic dataset with more than 20,000 covariates to illustrate its scalability.},

In particular, numerous studies have been conducted to predict the movement of stock market using machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine ({SVM}) and reinforcement learning. In this project, we propose a new prediction algorithm that exploits the temporal correlation among global stock markets and various financial products to predict the next-day stock trend with the aid of {SVM}. Numerical results indicate a prediction accuracy of 74.4\% in {NASDAQ}, 76\% in S\&P500 and 77.6\% in {DJIA}. The same algorithm is also applied with different regression algorithms to trace the actual increment in the markets. Finally, a simple trading model is established to study the performance of the proposed prediction algorithm against other benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Emerging container technologies, such as Docker, offer unprecedented agility in developing and running applications in cloud environment especially when combined with a microservice-style architecture. However, it is often difficult to use containers to manage the cloud infrastructure, without sacrificing many benefits container offers. This paper identifies the key challenges that impede realizing the full promise of containerizing infrastructure services. Using {OpenStack} as a case study, we explore solutions to these challenges. Specifically, we redesign {OpenStack} deployment architecture to enable dynamic service registration and discovery, explore different ways to manage service state in containers, and enable containers to access the host kernel and devices. We quantify the efficiency of the container-based microservice-style {DevOps} compared to the {VM}-based approach, and study the scalability of the stateless and stateful containerized components. We also discuss limitations in our current design, and highlight open research problems that, if solved, can lead to wider adoption of containers in cloud infrastructure management.},

Despite the reduced complexity and economic beneﬁts, the performance of offered cloud services often varies and strongly depends on the set up of cloud resources and the characteristics of workloads, making it difﬁcult for users to choose the right cloud provider. In this paper, the computational performance for single core workloads of the four major cloud providers’ serverless offerings is examined. Moreover, the performance and overhead, deﬁned as the time not spent with actual computation, is investigated for non-concurrent and concurrent requests and different cloud conﬁgurations. We provide ﬁndings on the variation and degradation of performance and enormous overhead for concurrent requests at some providers, which should be considered when relying on a serverless architecture.},

However, developers are tasked with managing this evolution and largely do so manually by continuously collecting and evaluating low-level service behaviors. This is tedious, error-prone, and slow. We argue for an approach based on service evolution modeling in which we combine static and dynamic information to generate an accurate representation of the evolving microservice-based system.

	title = {Microservices-Based Software Architecture and Approaches},
	doi = {10.1109/AERO.2017.7943959},
	abstract = {In the last few years, a revised software architecture style has been developed to design new software applications. This architecture style is particularly suited for use cases in the aerospace industry, from an independently deployable software service. The microservices architectural style develops a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. These services are built around business and mission capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated machinery. With microservices, some types of applications become easier to build and maintain when they are broken down into smaller, composable pieces that work together. Each component is then developed separately, and the application is then simply the sum of its constituent components. This is in contrast to a traditional, “monolithic” application which is all developed in one piece. This paper will discuss, several aspects of microservices-based architecture, including several potential use cases for the aerospace industry. The characteristics of microservice-based architecture such as componentization, organization, endpoints and messaging mechanisms. The technical implementation of microservices by reviewing containerization, services communication and related architectural components. Specific open source projects and components that can be utilized to build microservices-based architecture. A sample set of use cases.},

It provides an interface that greatly simplifies cloud programming, and represents an evolution that parallels the transition from assembly language to high-level programming languages. This paper gives a quick history of cloud computing, including an accounting of the predictions of the 2009 Berkeley View of Cloud Computing paper, explains the motivation for serverless computing, describes applications that stretch the current limits of serverless, and then lists obstacles and research opportunities required for serverless computing to fulfill its full potential. Just as the 2009 paper identified challenges for the cloud and predicted they would be addressed and that cloud use would accelerate, we predict these issues are solvable and that serverless computing will grow to dominate the future of cloud computing.},
